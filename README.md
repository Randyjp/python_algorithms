# Algorithms with Python

In this project I'm exploring several classic algorithms and their implementation. Most part of the practice questions
come form the book "Cracking the Coding Interview" 6th edition.
The main goal is getting exposure to as many algorithms as I can.   

### Prerequisites

To run the scripts you'll need any version of Python3 running on your computer
